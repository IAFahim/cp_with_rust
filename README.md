# cp_with_rust

I love rust like love it, it kinda makes me feel the task is done, when I write it, rather than feeling like, yeah I can do more modification with it. Runs really fast. Gives me full control doesn't make me feel you need to know this magic function and I can easily understand its code and think how its Assembly would look like.

But as I want to dive into networking and terrible at that subject, I am picking Golang for now, even though I don't understand half of what Golang is doing, and it feels I am being restricted by the language rather than being free.

Hope I get back to rust one day. It's a programming language I always looked for.

I will come back to you one day.
